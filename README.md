Data Structures and Algorithms

## Prologue
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data in a computer's memory. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, providing a way to manage and interact with data efficiently.

## Array
A collection of items of the <strong>same variable type</strong>, stored at contigious memory locations. It has two types: 
- <strong>Primitive array:</strong> They store data directly in the memory
- <strong>Object array:</strong> String[] arr = new String();

The operations in arrays:
- <strong>Traversal:</strong> the process of accessing each element in the array sequentially, it has two types: linear and reversal
- <strong>Insertion:</strong> at begining | at the end | at given position
- <strong>Deletion:</strong> from begining | from end | at given position | 1st occurrence of a given element from an array | all occurrences

## Searching Algorithms
- <strong>Core algorithms:</strong>
  - <strong>Linear search:</strong> Time complexity = O(n) ; Space complexity = O(1)
  - <strong>Binary search:</strong> Iterative & recursive ; Time complexity = O(log n) ; Space complexity = O(1)
- <strong>Other algorithms:</strong>
  - <strong>Ternary search:</strong> a variant of binary search that splits the array into 3 parts ; works on unimodal data ; Time complexity = O(log_{3}(n)) ; Space complexity = O(1)
  - <strong>Jump search:</strong> works on sorted arrays ; Time complexity = O(log_{3}(n)) ; Space complexity = O(1)
  - <strong>Interpolation search:</strong> works on uniform data ; Time complexity = O(log(log n)) ; Space complexity = O(1)
  - <strong>Fibonacci search:</strong>
  - <strong>Exponentiation search:</strong>

### ⚠Notes️:
- The log notation refers to logarithm, base 2 ; The log_{n} is logarithm base n
