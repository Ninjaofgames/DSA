## Prologue
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data in a computer's memory. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, providing a way to manage and interact with data efficiently.

## Array
A collection of items of the <strong>same variable type</strong>, stored at contigious memory locations. It has two types: 
- <strong>Primitive array:</strong> They store data directly in the memory
- <strong>Object array:</strong> String[] arr = new String();

The operations in arrays:
- <strong>Traversal:</strong> the process of accessing each element in the array sequentially, it has two types: linear and reversal
- <strong>Insertion:</strong> at begining | at the end | at given position
